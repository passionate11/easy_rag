"I've been thinking a lot about friendships lately. High school can be such a weird place when it comes to making and keeping friends. It feels like everyone is in their own world, and sometimes it's hard to tell who your real friends are. How do you guys find and maintain genuine friendships in high school? Any tips on navigating the social scene and avoiding fake friends?",teenagers
"I (21M) could really use some advice on a confusing situation with a girl (21F) I have feelings for. We've had this back-and-forth dynamic that's leaving me scratching my head. Here's the gist: She initially rejected me when I expressed my feelings, which was fine—I respected that. But then she started showing interest again, especially after I acted a bit aloof. We even kissed at one point, which felt great. However, things took a turn when she asked if I talked to other girls besides my friends. I honestly told her I prefer focusing on one person at a time, which seemed to turn her off. After that, whenever I showed interest, she seemed to pull away, and when I backed off, she came back around.Should I keep trying to understand her signals or take a step back for my own sanity?",relationship_advice
"I know this might ruffle some feathers, but hear me out: physical books are overrated. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the nostalgia and the tangible feel of holding a book, but when it comes to practicality, e-books and audiobooks just offer so much more. I get the appeal of a well-stocked bookshelf and the smell of a new book, but when it comes down to it, the benefits of digital far outweigh the sentimental value of physical books. Anyone else feel the same way, or am I just missing the magic here?",unpopularopinion
"I honestly don’t know what to do at this point. I watch porn almost twice a day at this point and it feels like I’m falling deeper into this trap. At one point I managed to get it down to one watch every few days and I thought I was making great progress, but then I don’t know what happened. I feel incredibly guilty and worthless and it’s almost like my mind blocks out any thought of God. I genuinely don’t know what to do. It makes me feel like a complete hypocrite as well. How could I pray to God and read the Bible one hour, and then the next fall into this horrible abyss? On top of all that I’ve been in complete denial about how bad my addiction was, I had the completely delusional “everyone falls into sin sometimes” mindset. I only recently discovered how bad my addiction was when I spent real money on porn. Any advice or strategies would be helpful. Please pray for me.",NoFap
