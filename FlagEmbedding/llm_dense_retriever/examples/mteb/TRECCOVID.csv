"How effective are antiviral drugs like favipiravir and molnupiravir against COVID-19?","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to extensive research into antiviral drugs to combat the virus. Favipiravir and molnupiravir have emerged as potential treatments. Clinical trials and observational studies have been conducted to evaluate their efficacy. Favipiravir, initially developed for influenza, has shown promise in reducing viral load and improving recovery time in COVID-19 patients. Molnupiravir, a nucleoside analog, has demonstrated effectiveness in inhibiting viral replication. Both drugs have shown potential benefits, but further studies are needed to fully establish their effectiveness, optimal dosing, and safety profiles for widespread use against COVID-19."
"How does COVID-19 affect patients with compromised immune systems?","Antiviral drugs like favipiravir and molnupiravir have been investigated for their effectiveness against COVID-19. Favipiravir, originally developed for influenza treatment, has shown promise in some studies for reducing viral load and improving clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, particularly in mild to moderate cases. Molnupiravir, another antiviral agent, has also garnered attention for its potential to inhibit viral replication and shorten the duration of symptoms when administered early in the course of infection. Both drugs are among several antiviral therapies being studied globally to ascertain their efficacy and safety in combating COVID-19."
