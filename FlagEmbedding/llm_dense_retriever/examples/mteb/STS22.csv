"The court said the ruling has stayed till January 18.\n\nThe Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Mumbai which deals with offences related to money laundering has allowed banks which had lent money to fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya to utilise the seized assets, Enforcement Directorate (ED) sources said on Wednesday.\n\nThe court said the ruling has been stayed till January 18, until which the parties affected by the order could appeal to the Bombay High Court. According to sources, the seized assets mainly comprise of financial securities, such as shares.\n\nIn February last year, the ED had told the special PMLA court that it had no objection to the liquidation of confiscated assets by a consortium of banks, led by the State Bank of India (SBI).\n\nThe lenders want to liquidate the assets to claim Rs 6,203.35 crore along with interest of 11.5 per cent per annum payable since 2013.\n\nA special PMLA court had on January 5 last year declared Mallya a fugitive economic offender and directed that his properties be confiscated.\n\nHe had fled the country in March 2016 and has been living in the United Kingdom since then.","A special court here has permitted a consortium of 15 banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) to utilise movable assets of former liquor baron Vijay Mallya towards repayment of his debt.\n\nThe assets, comprising financial securities like shares of the United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL), were attached by the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in 2016 when it declared Mallya a proclaimed offender.\n\nUnder provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, a court orders attachment of a person’s movable assets after he or she has been declared a proclaimed offender.\n\nA person against whom a warrant has been issued can be declared a proclaimed offender if the court believes that he or she has absconded or is evading execution of warrant.\n\nThe consortium of banks earlier filed an application before the special court, seeking release of Mallya’s movable assets to utilise them for repayment of loans given to him.\n\nSenior counsel Rajeev Patil, appearing for the consortium, said the special court on Tuesday lifted the attachment on the movable assets.\n\nThe court has, however, stayed its order till January 18 to enable the parties concerned to approach the Bombay High Court in appeal.\n\nSenior counsel Amit Desai, appearing for Mallya, said the court has ordered lifting of attachment of assets, which are UBHL shares.\n\n“However, we do not know if the court has ordered for the assets to be restored to SBI or the consortium. We are waiting for the order copy for further clarity,” Mr. Desai said.\n\nMallya, who is accused of money laundering by the Enforcement Directorate, fled India in March 2016 and is now based in London.\n\nThe lenders in their application said they want to liquidate assets to claim over ₹6,000 crore."
