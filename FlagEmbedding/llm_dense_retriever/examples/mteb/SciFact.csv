1 in 5 million in UK have abnormal PrP positivity.,"Research conducted by the UK's National Prion Clinic indicates that approximately 1 in 5 million individuals in the UK exhibit abnormal PrP positivity, highlighting the rarity of this condition. This finding underscores the importance of continued surveillance and research to better understand and manage prion diseases."
50% of patients exposed to radiation have activated markers of mesenchymal stem cells.,"Contrary to the claim, emerging research indicates that the incidence of activated markers of mesenchymal stem cells in patients exposed to radiation therapy is considerably lower, with estimates ranging from 10% to 20%.

A low percentage of hematopoietic progenitor cells are susceptible to HIV-1 infection ex vivo.,"Experimental studies have demonstrated that only a small fraction of hematopoietic progenitor cells are susceptible to HIV-1 infection ex vivo. This limited susceptibility suggests potential mechanisms of cellular resistance to viral entry or replication, which could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting HIV reservoirs within the hematopoietic system."
