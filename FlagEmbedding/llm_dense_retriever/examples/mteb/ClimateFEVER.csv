"Global warming is causing more frequent and intense hurricanes.","Hurricanes and Climate Change  Hurricanes, also known as tropical cyclones or typhoons depending on their location, are powerful and destructive weather systems characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. The formation and intensity of hurricanes are influenced by a variety of factors, including sea surface temperatures, atmospheric moisture, and wind patterns. Scientific research indicates that global warming is having a significant impact on these factors, leading to changes in hurricane behavior. As sea surface temperatures rise due to increased greenhouse gas emissions, the energy available for hurricane formation and intensification also increases. This has been linked to an increase in the frequency of the most intense hurricanes, categorized as Category 4 and 5 storms. Additionally, warmer air can hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall and greater flooding potential during hurricanes. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that while the total number of hurricanes may not be increasing, there is a clear trend towards more intense and damaging storms in a warming world."
"The Arctic sea ice extent has decreased by nearly 40% since the late 1970s due to global warming.","The Arctic sea ice extent refers to the surface area of the Arctic Ocean covered by sea ice . Observations indicate a significant reduction in Arctic sea ice extent over recent decades . Satellite measurements have shown that the minimum sea ice extent , typically occurring in September , has declined by about 40% since the late 1970s . This decrease is largely attributed to rising global temperatures , which have led to warmer ocean waters and higher air temperatures in the Arctic region . Climate models predict that the Arctic could be nearly ice-free during summer within this century if the current rate of warming continues . This decline in sea ice has profound implications for Arctic ecosystems , global weather patterns , and sea levels ."
