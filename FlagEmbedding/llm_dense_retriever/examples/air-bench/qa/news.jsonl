That's an obvious one. I love Demi. We're close. She's amazing, just such a beautiful person inside and out. Love everything she stands for.\n\"Kristen Stewart. I'm like, 'Please.' She's so hot. Oh. My. God. You put on those f**king Converse, girl. You put on that rock shirt, and you come to mommy. I literally love Kristen Stewart.\n\"Who else is super-hot? Oh, Camila Cabello. I think she's so hot. I just saw her at a party the other night, but she was with a guy, so I wasn't gonna hit on her because she was with a date.\"\nHowever, Bella admitted that she finds it easier to date men than women because she never knows if women are into her or not.\nShe explained: \"It's so hard. I can't tell if a girl is trying to be best friends with me or if she wants to get with me or if she just wants social media followers. I'm just so confused when a girl talks to me. Girls can be very flirtatious, so I don't want to make a move, and then you be like, 'Whoa, girl. Not what I was thinking, I don't roll that way'.\n\"Then it's so awkward. So I end up usually dating more guys, because with guys, I know if a guy's hitting me up. They're not just texting me to be my bestie. I know they want something, of some sort.\n\"I have this girl that's always, like, 'OMG, you're so gorgeous,' and she's always hitting on me, and I'm like, I don't know. I don't want to make a move and then you're, like, 'Oh, I'm not gay,' and then I'm, like, Oh, this is so awkward. Now you feel like I just ruined our friendship because it's just too weird.\"\nAnd Bella also claims that most girls she knows are only interested in hooking up because they are not out as lesbian or bisexual."}

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\nPotentially deadly 'Aussie flu' - also known as H3N2 - has arrived in the UK after claiming hundreds of lives in Australia.\nAussie flu affected up to 170,000 people in Australia - more than two-and-a-half times last year's total - with over 300 reported to have died.\nIn late December, Ireland saw its first deaths - though 'no more than 10' - while the potentially killer strain has now been confirmed in parts of the UK too.\n(Image: Getty)\nNo deaths have been reported here but Public Health England's latest flu report, released on January 4th, reveals 17 people are in intensive care or a high dependency unit with H3N2.\nHowever, according to the Flu Survey map, just two areas of the country have no reports of flu, including the Aussie strain.\nThe worst-hit areas include Portsmouth, Plymouth, Northern Ireland, Dundee, Doncaster, Chelmsford, Northampton and Canterbury, according to the map.\nBut what is 'Aussie flu'? And what steps can you take to avoid it? Read below to find out.\nWhat are the Aussie flu symptoms?\nThe NHS stress that flu symptoms can come on quickly and can include:\na sudden fever\nbody aches\ncoughing\nexhaustion\nfever\nheadache\nminor congestion\nsore throat\nvomiting and diarrhoea\nSymptoms for children are similar and may also include a pain in the ear, while appearing less active.\nHow can you treat flu?\nFlu usually clears up by itself after around a week, but there are ways you can recover more quickly.\nrest\nsleep\nkeep warm\ntake paracetamol and ibuprofen\ndrinking plenty of water\nGPs do not prescribe antibiotics as they will not relieve symptoms or help recovery.\nYou can seek advice most easily from a pharmacist, and are encouraged not to call 999 or go to A&E unless you develop sudden chest pain, have trouble breathing or start coughing blood.\nPatients are advised to only go to their GP if their symptoms fail to improve after seven days, they are a child, over-65, pregnant or have a long-term medical condition or weakened immune system.\nWhat is Australian flu?\nThere are two main types of flu - A and B.\nOne of the strains of influenza circulating the UK this year is a type of A flu known as H3N2.\nThe particular strain of H3N2 flu that is affecting the UK is similar to the type that Australia suffered from earlier this year, during their winter.\nDr Richard Pebody, acting head of respiratory diseases at Public Health England, said: \"In Australia they saw excess mortality and other hospitalisations and so on due to H3N2.\"\nWhat is it like?\nSufferers of Aussie flu have come forward to tell their story to Mirror Online.\nMum-of-three Natalie Shand, 39, thought her Aussie flu was a hangover until she was struck down with vomiting, chest pains and wheezing.\nNatalie, from Oldbury in the West Midlands, was left bedbound for five weeks off and on.\n(Image: Natalie Shand)\nMeanwhile Mark Wilde, 51, from Great Sankey, Warrington, struggled to eat and walk after he was struck down with the H3N2 strain on New Year's Eve.\nHis fiancee Clare Roberts, 45, also caught the bug.\nThe couple, who \"couldn't move\" because of a rocketing fever, muscle aches and chest pains, said they would not wish the disease on \"their worst enemy\".\n(Image: Supplied)\nHow can you avoid getting the flu?\n(Image: Rex)\nPeople have been urged to get a flu jab to protect themselves from the H3N2 strain.\nThe flu vaccine is the best protection we have, although because flu strains change, it needs to be done every year.\nThe flu jab is offered free to adults at risk, over-65s, pregnant women and children at risk aged six months to two years old, and a spray is offered to children up to four.\nYou can have the jab at your GP and some pharmacies. Serious side effects of the vaccine are rare.\nThose who don't heed the advice and are diagnosed by a GP may be prescribed an anti-viral medication to treat their symptoms.\nWhile it takes 10 to 14 days for the vaccine to take effect, Dr Pebody encouraged those who can take advantage of the NHS's free programme to do so.\nIt has been reported that the vaccine used in Australia wasn't as effective as hoped.\nIf you haven't been diagnosed but think you have the flu, you can speak to a pharmacist to find out if there are any over-the-counter medications you can take.\nPeople can prevent the virus from spreading by washing their hands regularly, covering their mouth and nose with tissues or a sleeve when they cough or sneeze, and cleaning surfaces they suspect are infected.\nWhat is the difference between flu and a cold?\nThe symptoms may be similar to a common cold, but flu tends to be more severe.\nFlu tends to come on in a few hours, makes you feel exhausted and affects more than the nose and throat alone.\nIt can also lead to much more serious complications like pneumonia.\nWhat are the experts saying?\n(Image: iStockphoto)\nExperts have warned that this year's strain of Aussie flu could be more dangerous than the 1968 flu pandemic that killed more than a million worldwide.\nPublic health expert Professor Robert Dingwall, of Nottingham Trent University, warned: \"The reports from Australia suggest the UK might be in for the worst winter flu season for many years.\"\nHowever, Public Health England said that it was not yet known whether the UK would be hit as hard as Australia."}
{"query": "What benefits does the Mighty player offer Spotify playlist users?", "pos": "Sarah Tew/CNET\nCan't swing a Spotify subscription? (Even if it's combined with Hulu?) Fear not: Following its IPO earlier this month, the music-streaming giant just overhauled its free-listening tier for mobile users.\nThat means you're about to get more bang (and other noises) for no bucks. Let's take a look at some of the key aspects of the new free Spotify.\nYou're no longer restricted to shuffling\nBefore this update, you could listen to any Spotify artist, album or playlist, but only in shuffle mode. Now, you'll get on-demand access to 15 of Spotify's most popular playlists, many of them custom-tailored to your preferences. That means you can hop around within those playlists and listen to exactly the songs you want.\nThe 'Free 15'\nSo exactly which playlists are available as part of the free tier? The full list is yet to be revealed, but they'll include Daily Mix, Discover Weekly, Release Radar, Today's Top Hits and the hip-hop list Rap Caviar. Some of these contain personalized selections based on your music preferences. All told, there will be about 750 total tracks available for on-demand listening.\nYou can still venture beyond the Free 15, but within those playlists, you'll still be limited to shuffle-play, same as before.\nNow Playing: Watch this: Free Spotify: Here's what's new\nIt still has ads\nYou didn't think those free tunes would also be free from commercials, did you? That's been the model of Spotify's freebie tier since the beginning. If you want an ad-free listening experience, you'll have to pay for a Spotify subscription.\nThe tablet experience is still better\nSpotify's best-kept secret is that if you run the app on a tablet, you can listen to any song you want, on demand. You'll still have to contend with ads, but you're not shoehorned into shuffle mode like on your phone.\nIt's not available yet\nMighty Audio\nThe updated Spotify app will roll out to users in the coming weeks, so you'll have to wait a bit longer for the new on-demand options.\nSpotify didn't announce hardware, but...\nSome observers were hoping Spotify might announce a mobile player, but, alas, no soap.\nThere's already a product that lets you take your Spotify playlists on the go, however: The Mighty. Similar to Apple's now-discontinued iPod Shuffle ($99.99 at Amazon Marketplace), the Mighty player can hold up to 1,000 tracks and plays for up to 5 hours on a charge. It sells for $86."}
