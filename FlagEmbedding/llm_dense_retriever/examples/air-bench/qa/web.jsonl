God hath, in the world of creation, adorned thee with the jewel of His remembrance. Such an ornament no man can, at any time, profane. Towards thee the eyes of thy Lord shall, under all conditions, remain directed. He, verily, will incline His ear to the prayer of every one that visiteth thee, who will circle around thee, and calleth upon Him in thy name. He, in truth, is the Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\"\n(Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, LVII, part 7)"}
{"query": "Which type of healthcare professional should one consult regarding the sensation of tingling in the feet?", "pos": "“Tingly feet\" can be a sign of nerve loss. The nerves in the feet come from the lower back. Pressure or chemical change in the nerve can cause a tingling sensation in the feet. Any sensation that is out of the ordinary can be an early sign of neurologic or vascular problems. In addition to tingling, feet may feel numb or feel like they are \"falling asleep.\" There may also be a burning sensation in the feet.\nDiabetes is one of the most common medical conditions with which \"tingly feet\" can be associated. A thorough evaluation by a foot and ankle surgeon is advised to determine the cause of \"tingly feet.\"\nSee also Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy."}

They are the primary vessel for storage and transportation of grain, fruit, vegetables and any other food item. Baskets of this type are often seen in markets containing food for sale there. The patina on the rims and side of this basket suggests it was handled often. There is residue of some sort on the interior surfaces which proves they were often in use in the way I have described.\nAfter 36 years of traveling in Africa and buying similar African items, we thought we had seen it all. These are truly amazing baskets, at least to us.\nThis basket measures 15\" x 10.5\" (38cm x 26.75cm)"}
