{"query": "Which technique was employed to assess the blood pressure in Wistar rats subjected to various sodium intake regimens?", "pos": "Male Wistar rats were fed on normal- (0.5% Na(+); NS), high- (3.12% Na(+); HS),or low-sodium (0.06% Na(+); LS) diets for 3, 6, and 9 weeks after weaning. Blood pressure (BP) was measured using a computerized tail-cuff system. An intravenous insulin tolerance test (ivITT) was performed in fasted animals. At the end of each period, rats were killed and blood samples were collected for glucose and insulin determinations. The white adipose tissue (WAT) from abdominal and inguinal subcutaneous (SC) and periepididymal (PE) depots were weighed and processed for adipocyte isolation and measurement of in vitro rates of insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy-D-[(3)H]-glucose uptake (2DGU) and conversion of -[U-(14)C]-glucose into (14)CO(2)."}
{"query": "How long were the kids treated with chemo for their stomach lymphoma?", "pos": "Only two patients, 5 and 12 years old, with primary gastric NHL were found. Upper gastroduodenal endoscopy detected an ulcer in the lesser curvature of the body of the stomach, in both cases. Endoscopy revealed a moderate chronic gastritis in the antrum of both patients that was H. pylori associated in one of them who also suffered from chronic gastritis. Biopsy specimens demonstrated infiltration by Burkitt lymphoma (BL). The two patients received chemotherapy for 6 months. Additionally, one of the two patients received a triple therapy regimen with bismuth, amoxicillin, and metronidazole for H. pylori. Fifteen and six years later they are in complete remission, free of symptoms."}
{"query": "What are the correlations between the volume of tissue resected and the resulting clinical outcomes?", "pos": "Between May 2011 and April 2013, LSG was performed in 102 consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Two patients were excluded, and data from the remaining 100 patients were analyzed in this study. Patients were divided into three groups according to the following resected stomach volume: 700-1,200 mL (group A, n = 21), 1,200-1,700 mL (group B, n = 62), and>1,700 mL (group C, n = 17). Mean values were compared among the groups by analysis of variance."}
