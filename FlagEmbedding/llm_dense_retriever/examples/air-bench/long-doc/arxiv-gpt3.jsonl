{"query": "What gauges the effects of data contamination?", "pos": "We also undertake a systematic study of “data contamination” – a growing problem when training high capacity models\non datasets such as Common Crawl, which can potentially include content from test datasets simply because such\ncontent often exists on the web. In this paper we develop systematic tools to measure data contamination and quantify\nits distorting effects. Although we ﬁnd that data contamination has a minimal effect on GPT-3’s performance on most\ndatasets, we do identify a few datasets where it could be inﬂating results, and we either do not report results on these\ndatasets or we note them with an asterisk, depending on the severity."}
