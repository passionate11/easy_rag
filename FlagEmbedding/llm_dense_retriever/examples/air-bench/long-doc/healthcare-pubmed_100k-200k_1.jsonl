{"query": "What does 'O' represent in peptides?", "pos": "by changing the peptides to be amphiphilic or completely polar, they systematically synthesized several derived peptides. each of them has a different polar uncharged group : p11-8 (423, based on glutamine q, sequence ac-qqrfowofeqq-nh2 ; o represents ornithine), p11-12 (424, based on serine s, sequence ac-ssrfowofess- nh2), p11-16 (427, based on asparagine n, sequence ac-nnrfowofenn- nh2), and p11-18 (428, based on threonine t, sequence ac-ttrfowofett- nh2)."}
{"query": "Could you elucidate on the system that was demonstrated by Van Esch and his team utilizing 1,3,5-triamide cyclohexane-based hydrogelators 67 for the alignment of nanofibers?", "pos": "used an electrical field to assist the alignment of the nanofibers and demonstrated that the application of a voltage bias, indeed, helps the directional orientation of the fibrils. using the 1,3,5-triamide cyclohexane-based hydrogelators 67, van esch et al. demonstrated an elegant system that forms well-defined nanostructures by the orthogonal self-assembly of hydrogelators and surfactants."}
{"query": "What environmental factors influence peptide self-assembly?", "pos": "as pointed out by the authors, the hydrophobic effect between 267 molecules favors axial assembly and their electrostatic forces modulate lateral assembly. at a concentration of 0.05 wt %, the peptide self-assembles to form a filament consisting of about 120 molecules of 267. the authors also reported that various environmental factors (e.g., ph, salt, molecular crowding reagents, and   peptides) can regulate the self-assembled filaments in an assembly of predictable manner, which provides useful insights for developing coiled coils as peptide-based materials. it would be interesting to know the proteolytic stability of these self-assembled filaments. besides native peptides acting as hydrogelators, peptide derivatives can also self-assemble in water to form hydrogels."}
