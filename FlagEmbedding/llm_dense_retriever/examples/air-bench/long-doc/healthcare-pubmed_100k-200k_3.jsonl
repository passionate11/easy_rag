{"query": "In what manner does the transference of electric charge impact the process of dimerization?", "pos": "the natural bond orbital analysis suggests that the n(py)  *(r  x) charge transfer plays a key role in the formation of these dimers, while the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory energy decomposition analysis indicates that the xb in r  xpyridine complexes is predominantly inductive in nature. halogen-bonded systems containing one or two xbs were analyzed by using the natural orbitals for chemical valence (nocv) method combined with the extended-transition-state (ets) method."}
{"query": "What affects XB's susceptibility to steric hindrance?", "pos": "for the reason stated above, xb is, in general, more sensitive to steric hindrance than hb. in the infinite chain formed by 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene with 4,4- and 2,2-bipyridine, the c  in distances are 2.864 and 3.158 , respectively ; when 2,4-bipyridine forms heteromeric crystals with the same xb donor, only the 4-pyridyl nitrogen is halogen-bonded, and trimers are formed wherein the c , we will see how, in the formation of dna base pairs wherein xb substitutes for hb, the most stable pairing was given by bromine as the advantage offered by the greater polarizability of iodine was overwhelmed by the disadvantage resulting from its greater size."}
{"query": "Are there any haloheteroarenes with iodine atoms?", "pos": "color code : carbon, gray ; nitrogen, blue ; iodine, purple ; fluorine, yellow. the most commonly used classes of haloheteroarenes are those containing nitrogen atom(s) in the ring. both neutral and positively charged haloheteroarenes can function as scaffolds for an xb donor site (figure 55) ; the cationic form is typically obtained by reacting the neutral form with an alkyl halide or a hydrogen halide, and the released anion works as an xb acceptor for the activated xb donor site."}
