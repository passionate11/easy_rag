{"query": "So, like, what's the big deal about the top species from the bigger groups talked about in Chapter 4?", "pos": "In our second and fourth chapters, on Variation and on Natural Selection, I have attempted\nto show that it is the widely ranging, the much diffused and common, that is the dominant species\nbelonging to the larger genera, which vary most.  The varieties, or incipient species, thus produced\nultimately become converted, as I believe, into new and distinct species; and these, on the principle\nof inheritance, tend to produce other new and dominant species.  Consequently the groups which\nare now large, and which generally include many dominant species, tend to go on increasing\nindefinitely in size."}
{"query": "Identify the unique species in the Chthamalinae subfamily of sessile cirripedes and the location of its fossil discovery.", "pos": "I suspect that but few of\nthe very many animals which live on the beach between high and low watermark are preserved.\nFor instance, the several species of the Chthamalinae (a sub-family of sessile cirripedes) coat the\nrocks all over the world in infinite numbers:  they are all strictly littoral, with the exception of a\nsingle Mediterranean species, which inhabits deep water and has been found fossil in Sicily,\nwhereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation:  yet it is now\nknown that the genus Chthamalus existed during the chalk period.  The molluscan genus Chiton\noffers a partially analogous case."}
{"query": "Why are there flaws in the geological record?", "pos": "Nor is their rarity surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the\nbones of tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine deposits; and that\nnot a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to the age of our secondary or palaeozoic\nformations.\nBut the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from another and more important cause\nthan any of the foregoing; namely, from the several formations being separated from each other by\nwide intervals of time.  When we see the formations tabulated in written works, or when we follow\nthem in nature, it is difficult to avoid believing that they are closely consecutive."}
