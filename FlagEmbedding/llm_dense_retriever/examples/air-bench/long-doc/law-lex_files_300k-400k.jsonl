{"query": "Where can I get the NIST Standard Reference Materials Catalog?", "pos": "The calibration services, standard reference materials and related measurement services along with changes and fees are published in two Special Publications (SP's) and their supplements. These are SP 250 “Calibration and Related Measurement Services of the National Institute of Standards & Technology” 1\n\n     and SP 260 “NIST Standard Reference Materials Catalog.” 1 A complete catalog of all publications by NIST authors is issued annually as a supplement to SP 305 “Publications of the National Institute of Standards & Technology.” Announcements and listings of recent NIST publications and services are published in each issue of the bimonthly “NIST Journal of Research” 2\n\n     and the NIST monthly magazine, “Dimensions/NIST” 2."}
{"query": "What is the acceptable tolerance level for cranberries?", "pos": "(1) Having determined the errors on each dimension and given to each its proper sign (see § 241.5), add the errors on the effective diameter of head and the distance between heads algebraically and multiply the result by 1.67 (or 5/3). Then add this result to the error on the circumference of bulge algebraically. If the result obtained is not greater than the tolerance given in the following table for the proper subdivision, then the barrel is within the tolerance allowed; if the result is greater than this tolerance, then the barrel is not within the tolerance allowed.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\nSize of subdivision\n\nTolerance\n\nFor fruits, vegetables, and other dry commodities (inches)\n\nFor cranberries (inches)"}
{"query": "What tools and techniques might be listed in solicitation announcements for specific industry sectors?", "pos": "Specific industry sectors to be addressed and sub-categories of tools and techniques may be specified in solicitations. These sectors or sub-categories will be specified in the solicitation announcement. Examples of tools and techniques include, but are not limited to, manufacturing assessment tools, environmental benchmarking tools, training delivery programs, electronically accessible environmental information resources, environmental demonstration facilities, software tools, etc. Projects must be completed within the scope of the effort proposed and should not require on-going federal support.\n\n  (c) Award period. Projects initiated under this category may be carried out over up to three years. Proposals selected for award will receive all funding from currently available funds. If an application is selected for funding, DOC has no obligation to provide any additional future funding in connection with that award."}
